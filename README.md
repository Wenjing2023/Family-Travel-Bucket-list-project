Travel Bucket List

Build an app to track your travel adventures.

MVP:

The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
The user should be able to create and edit users.
The admin will set up some countries.
Each country should have one or more cities to visit
The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see

Possible Extensions:

Have separate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit
Add sights to the destination cities
Search for destination by continent, city or country
